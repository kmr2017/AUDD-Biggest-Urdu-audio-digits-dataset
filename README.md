# AUDD-Biggest-Urdu-audio-digits-dataset
Urdu is a national language of Pakistan and is also widely spoken in many other South Asian countries (e.g., India, Nepal, Afghanistan). Therefore, we present a comprehensive dataset of spoken Urdu digits ranging from 0 to 9. Our dataset has 23071 sound samples that are collected from 249 participants. Additionally, we propose a convolutional neural network (CNN), that shows the best performance. Meanwhile, we provide baseline classification accuracy using different neural network models. We consider Support Vector Machine (SVM), Multilayer perceptron (MLP), Xception, and 8 flavors of efficientnetâ€¦ Our results will serve as guidelines for baseline accuracy for the proposed dataset.  Note: This dataset is for research purpose.    In processed data directory, audio sample is processed to mel-spectrogram of 32 x 32 shape.
